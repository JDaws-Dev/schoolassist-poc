## About Artios

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Name** | Artios Academies of Sugar Hill |
| **Type** | Christian Homeschool Hybrid / University-Model |
| **Tagline** | Art. Heart. Smart. |
| **Address** | 415 Brogdon Road, Suwanee, GA 30024 |

### What is a University-Model School?

Artios is a **homeschool hybrid** where:
- Students attend on-campus classes certain days
- Students complete assignments at home on other days
- Parents partner with teachers but **do not need to teach academic content**
- This model provides the best of both worlds: professional instruction + family flexibility

**How It Works**:
- Teachers provide weekly integrated assignments for parents as a springboard for learning at home
- Students attend structured classes on campus on designated days (schedule varies by grade level)
- Parents play an active role in their children's education while teachers handle professional instruction
- The model operates as an extension of parental authority rather than a replacement

### Name Origin & History

The school's name "Artios" derives from **2 Timothy 3:16-17** ("All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly prepared for every good work"). The word "Artios" comes from the Greek word in this passage meaning "thoroughly prepared" or "complete/equipped." This foundational concept drives the educational philosophy at Artios.

**Founding**: Artios Academies was founded in 1998 by Lori Lane as the Artios Academy for the Visual and Performing Arts, originally an advanced-level arts program for homeschooled high school students. The organization has since grown to include complete integrated arts and academics programs for K-12.

### Multi-Campus Organization

2. **The Conservatory** - An intensive practicum in Music, Theater, Worldview, and the Arts for High School students (9th-12th grade).

## Mission & Core Values

### Mission Statement

Artios **partners with parents** to raise children who **love God**, **know His Word**, and are **fully equipped to serve others** and **reflect Christ in their lives**.

### Art. Heart. Smart Value Statements

- **ART** | At Artios we value people because they are artfully created in God's image with unique giftings and backgrounds used to serve God and others.

- **HEART** | We prioritize the heart because it is the wellspring of life, and is best discipled through the family and a Christ-centered community.

- **SMART** | We smartly root our lives in God and His Word as the source of truth and wisdom.

### Our Core Values

1. **Value The Person** - We value people and the unique talents, creative gifts, and backgrounds God gave them.

2. **Prioritize The Heart** - We prioritize the heart as the wellspring of life and the object of discipleship.

3. **Focus On Family** - We focus on family and the irreplaceable role it plays in discipling students.

4. **Steward The Community** - We foster a Christ-centered and service-oriented community.

5. **Live Biblically Rooted** - We put Christ and His Word at the center of our lives, and pursue His wisdom. We do what God says is right, even when it's unpopular or we don't know the outcome.

### Educational Philosophy

Artios offers "the most creative and integrative approach to educating the whole-hearted child." The organization views truth as manifesting throughout history in the form of art, events, people, leaders, and leading ideas. Rather than compartmentalizing subjects, Artios teaches students to contextualize historical content as interconnected parts of a broader narrative - "one giant story that God has been telling since Genesis 1:1."

**Learning Outcomes**: An Artios education equips students to compare and contrast all ideas and art forms as either Truth or something that stands opposed to Truth. This process aims to develop three key areas:
- **Character shaping** - Building moral and ethical foundations
- **Confidence building** - Developing self-assurance and capability
- **Conscience sharpening** - Refining spiritual and ethical discernment

**Partnership Model**: Artios partners with parents to raise children who love God, know His Word, and are fully equipped to serve others and reflect Christ in their lives. Parents partner with teachers but do not need to teach academic content.

---

## Statement of Beliefs

Artios Academies holds to the following core theological positions:

### Scripture (Sola Scriptura)
The 66 books of the Bible constitute the complete, verbally inspired Word of God. Scripture is totally sufficient and must not be added to, superseded, or changed by later tradition.

### The Trinity
God exists as three distinct, coequal persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—sharing identical nature and attributes.

### Creation
God created the universe directly, not through evolutionary processes. Genesis is a factual narrative of historical events.

### Original Sin
Humans were created in God's image but chose rebellion, resulting in universal sinfulness affecting all people.

### Salvation (Sola Fide and Sola Gratia)
Salvation comes exclusively through personal trust in Christ by faith and grace alone. Righteous works result from salvation rather than contributing to it. The organization affirms eternal security in grace.

### Jesus Christ
Christ is fully God and man whose death redeems believers. He rose bodily, ascended to God's right hand, and will return visibly to establish an eternal kingdom.

### Marriage
Marriage represents a covenantal life-long relationship exclusively between man and woman as originally created, following patterns established in Scripture.

### Human Sexuality
All consensual sexual activity is restricted to marriage between a man and woman. The statement specifically prohibits sexual activity between persons of the same sex, along with other practices including adultery, fornication, and pornography.

### Gender Identity
Individual gender is assigned by God and determined at conception. Intentionally altering physical gender or living as a different gender constitutes rejection of His plan.

### Sanctity of Life
Human life begins at conception, with unborn children possessing personhood and full human rights.

**Note**: The organization reserves the right to apply these positions to employment, hiring, admissions, discipline, and institutional decisions.
