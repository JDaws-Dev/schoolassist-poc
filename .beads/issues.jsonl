Investigate ways to make it more welcoming and engaging.\n\n## Ideas to Explore\n- **GroupMe API**: Can we show member count, recent activity, or preview?\n- **Facebook Graph API**: Can we pull group info, member count, or cover image?\n- **Static images**: Add GroupMe/Facebook logos or group cover photos\n- **Descriptions**: Add context about what each group is for\n- **Visual cards**: Make each link feel like a destination, not just a link\n- **Onboarding flow**: Guide new parents to join the right groups\n\n## Questions to Answer\n1. Do GroupMe/Facebook have public APIs we can use without auth?\n2. What info can we display without requiring user login?\n3. Are there embed options (like Facebook Page Plugin)?\n4. What would make a busy mom feel welcomed vs overwhelmed?\n\n## Reference\n- Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/thequeenmothersofartios\n- GroupMe links in CLAUDE.md","acceptance_criteria":"- [x] Research GroupMe API capabilities documented - VERIFIED: GroupMe requires OAuth for all requests, no public endpoints available\n- [x] Research Facebook Graph API / embed options documented - VERIFIED: Groups API shut down in 2024, private groups cannot be embedded\n- [x] Recommend approach (API, static images, or enhanced UX) - VERIFIED: Recommended enhanced UX approach (descriptions, onboarding guidance)\n- [x] If API viable: document auth requirements and limitations - VERIFIED: APIs NOT viable - documented auth requirements (OAuth for GroupMe, admin access for Facebook)\n- [x] Provide mockup or description of improved UI - VERIFIED: Documented 5 UX improvements: visual context, descriptions for each group, \"Why Join?\" section, onboarding guidance","notes":"## Research Findings\n\n### GroupMe API\n**Verdict: NOT VIABLE without authentication**\n\nSources: [GroupMe Developers](https://dev.groupme.com/), [OpenGM API Documentation](https://groupme-js.github.io/GroupMeCommunityDocs/)\n\n- GroupMe API requires OAuth authentication for ALL requests\n- Two methods: Webhook Bots (need callback URL) or User Bots (need personal access token)\n- No public endpoint to get group info, member count, or activity\n- Cannot display any GroupMe data without storing user credentials (security concern)\n- Official docs are outdated; community maintains better docs\n\n### Facebook Graph API / Embeds\n**Verdict: LIMITED - requires admin access and third-party tools**\n\nSources: [Meta Graph API Overview](https://data365.co/blog/meta-graph-api), [Facebook Groups API Shutdown - TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/05/meta-cuts-off-third-party-access-to-facebook-groups-leaving-developers-and-customers-in-disarray/), [SociableKIT Tutorial](https://www.sociablekit.com/tutorials/embed-facebook-group-feed-website/)\n\n**Key findings:**\n1. Meta shut down the Facebook Groups API in early 2024\n2. Graph API v22.0 (current) has strict permissions and rate limits\n3. Private/closed groups cannot be embedded legally or technically\n4. \"Queen Mothers of Artios\" is likely a private group (most parent groups are)\n5. Embedding requires being an admin of the group\n6. Third-party tools (SociableKIT, Smash Balloon) exist but:\n   - Require Facebook admin credentials\n   - Add complexity and potential points of failure\n   - Privacy concerns - do parents want their posts visible outside the group?\n\n### Facebook Page Plugin (Official)\n- Only works for **Pages** and **Public Groups**\n- Our group is almost certainly private (standard for school parent groups)\n- Not applicable\n\n## Recommended Approach: Enhanced UX (No API)\n\nGiven the API limitations, I recommend improving the Community page through **better UX design** rather than API integrations:\n\n### 1. Add Visual Context\n- GroupMe and Facebook logos/icons (already partially done with Users icon)\n- Consider actual brand colors: GroupMe teal (#00AFF0), Facebook blue (#1877F2)\n\n### 2. Add Descriptions\nCurrently the page just shows link names. Add context about what each group is for:\n- **Queen Mothers**: \"Main Facebook group for all parents - announcements, questions, volunteer coordination\"\n- **Elementary (K-6)**: \"Daily updates, lunch orders, field trip coordination for elementary families\"\n- **Junior High (7-8)**: \"Junior high specific discussions, event planning, parent connections\"\n- **High School (9-12)**: \"High school events, senior activities, college prep discussions\"\n\n### 3. Visual Cards (Already Implemented)\nThe current implementation already uses card-style links with hover states - this is good.\n\n### 4. Add \"Why Join?\" Section\nBrief explanation of what these groups are used for:\n- Lost \u0026 found\n- Last-minute volunteer requests\n- Field trip coordination\n- Book/uniform sales\n- Quick reminders\n- Community support\n\n### 5. Onboarding Guidance\nAdd a brief note: \"New to Artios? Join your grade-level GroupMe first - that's where you'll find day-to-day communication.\"\n\n## What Would NOT Work\n- Showing member counts (requires API auth)\n- Showing recent activity/posts (requires API auth + privacy concerns)\n- Embedding feeds (requires admin access + privacy concerns)\n- Cover photos (requires API access)\n\n## Implementation Estimate\nThe recommended UX improvements are low-effort, no-API changes that can be done in a single PR.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jedaws@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T10:16:59.219138-05:00","created_by":"Jeremiah Daws","updated_at":"2026-01-29T10:53:39.712589-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-29T10:53:39.712589-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
