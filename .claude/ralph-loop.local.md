create an alternate stripped down version of artios connect as a new branch with a localhost for testing before we push it. Need to strip out all the facts/renweb api stuff and just make it for parents to get all the information, calendar events, and notifications, plus an admin backend for admins to enter in documents and info people need to know plus event info, etc... and important dates, etc... So a landing page that's just got the upcoming dates, links to important events, etc... Here's the latest linktree plus you should already have the documents and calendars that are relevant... plus the chatgpt open ai api, etc...
